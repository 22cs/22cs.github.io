*[Gamification](/literature/topics/gamification)* *is not the same as game design, because it adds game-like elements to non-gaming environments. However, there is some overlap between game design and gamification design, and one area in which this is the case is with player types. The better you understand your players, the better you can cater to their needs.*​*[游戏化](/literature/topics/gamification)*​*与游戏设计不同，因为它将类似游戏的元素添加到非游戏环境中。然而，游戏设计和游戏化设计之间有一些重叠，其中一个领域就是玩家类型。你越了解你的玩家，你就越能满足他们的需求。*

## The Psychology of the Player

玩家的心理

When you’re using gamification in the enterprise world, it’s a good idea to understand how your players like to approach playing games. Good news - there is a simple measure designed by Richard Bartle, the Bartle Test of Psychology, which breaks up the way people play games into four simple categories. These categories are the Achiever, the Explorer, the Socializer, and the Killer.  
当您在企业界使用游戏化时，了解玩家喜欢以何种方式玩游戏是个好主意。好消息是，理查德·巴特尔 \(Richard Bartle\) 设计了一个简单的测量方法，即巴特尔心理学测试，它将人们玩游戏的方式分为四个简单的类别。这些类别是成就者、探索者、社交者和杀手。

It’s worth noting that these categories *aren’t* rigid. Most people display some traits in more than one category. However, most people have a dominant trait which determines their overall preference. If you know where the majority of your players fall using this tool, you can use it to inform the majority of features you will use, and then just add a small number of features that appeal to each of the other categories.  
值得注意的是，这些类别*并不是固定不变*的。大多数人会表现出不止一种类别的特征。但是，大多数人都有一个主导特征，决定了他们的整体偏好。如果您知道大多数玩家使用此工具时属于哪个类别，则可以使用它来告知您将使用的大多数功能，然后只需添加少量对其他每个类别有吸引力的功能即可。

## The Achiever

成就者

Achievers are all about points and status. They want to be able to show their friends how they are progressing. They like to collect badges and put them on display. This is the type of person who responds particularly well to incentive schemes such as Air Miles, where every additional mile collected is an [achievement](/literature/topics/achievements) in its own right. Bartle estimates that roughly 10% of people are players of the Achiever type. Chances are you will know several people of this sort; someone who boasts he used a quicker route to get to a destination than his friend did is an Achiever type.  
成就者只关心积分和地位。他们希望能够向朋友展示自己的进步。他们喜欢收集徽章并展示出来。这类人对航空里程等激励计划反应特别好，因为每多收集一英里，本身就是一项[成就](/literature/topics/achievements)。Bartle 估计大约有 10% 的人是成就者类型的玩家。你很可能认识几个这样的人；有人夸耀自己比朋友走的更快的路线到达目的地，他就属于成就者类型。

## The Explorer

探索者

Explorers want to see new things and discover new secrets. They’re not as bothered about points or prizes. For them, *discovery* **is the prize. Explorers are fine with repetitive tasks as long as they eventually “unlock” a new area of the game, or they deliver some kind of “Easter Egg”**    **(an Easter Egg is a small bonus within a game – sometimes it’s as simple as a little joke, whereas in other cases it might be a full extra video sequence regarding what has been accomplished). Explorers really enjoy the surprise that’s possible in a game, and around 10% of players fit into this category. These are the players who will feel at walls in a game in order to access a secret passage; their satisfaction on doing so is what makes them tick, not bragging to their friends about their discovery. Build this sort of feature into your gamification design—and you’ll be speaking their language.探索者希望看到新事物并发现新秘密。他们不太在意积分或奖品。对他们来说，**​*发现*就是奖品。探索者不介意重复的任务，只要他们最终“解锁”游戏的新区域，或者提供某种“复活节彩蛋”（复活节彩蛋是游戏中的小奖励——有时它只是一个简单的小笑话，而在其他情况下，它可能是有关已完成任务的完整额外视频序列）。探索者真的很喜欢游戏中可能出现的惊喜，大约 10% 的玩家属于这一类。这些玩家会在游戏中触摸墙壁以进入秘密通道；这样做的满足感是他们玩得开心的原因，而不是向朋友吹嘘他们的发现。将这种功能融入您的游戏化设计中——您将使用他们的语言。

探索型玩家希望看到新事物并体验新的结果。

## The Socializer

社交者

The vast majority of players are Socializers. That’s almost 80% of people who play games. Socializers experience fun in their games through their interaction with other players. Socializers are happy to collaborate in order to achieve bigger and better things than they could on their own. Games, such as Farmville \(Facebook’s largest game\), appeal to the Socializer. For instance, Socializers are happy to water someone else’s farm in exchange for new crops for their own farm. For example, office workers who leave at the end of the day and remind each other to water each others’ crops may be friends… or they may just be acquaintances. Whatever the deal is, the point with Socializers is that joining forces makes sense to them. Note—this is the last place you’ll find fierce competition, but it doesn’t mean Socializers are passive milksops who lack ambition.  
绝大多数玩家都是社交型玩家。几乎 80% 的玩家都是社交型玩家。社交型玩家通过与其他玩家的互动在游戏中体验乐趣。社交型玩家乐于合作，以实现比他们自己单打独斗时更大更好的目标。诸如《Farmville》（Facebook 最大的游戏）等游戏对社交型玩家很有吸引力。例如，社交型玩家乐于为他人的农场浇水，以换取自己农场的新作物。例如，下班后提醒彼此浇水的办公室职员可能是朋友……或者他们可能只是熟人。无论如何，社交型玩家的重点是，联合起来对他们来说是有意义的。注意——这是你最不可能发现激烈竞争的地方，但这并不意味着社交型玩家是缺乏野心的被动懦夫。

Farmville 等游戏融入了社交体验，吸引了社交型玩家类型。

## The Killer

凶手

The Killer denotes an ominous-sounding type, but one that is nonetheless valid. Killers are similar to Achievers in the way that they get a thrill from gaining points and winning status too. What sets them apart from Achievers is that the Killers want to see other people *lose*. They’re highly competitive, and winning is what motivates them. They want to be the best at the game—and it should come as little surprise that the only way for *that* to be true is if they beat *everyone else*. You may expect this personality type to be common, but Bartle’s research suggests that only a small number of players are Killers – less than 1% to be precise.  
杀手型人格听起来不祥，但却是真实存在的。杀手型人格与成就型人格相似，他们也会从获得积分和胜利中获得快感。与成就型人格不同之处在于，杀手型人格希望看到其他人*失败*。他们竞争意识很强，获胜是他们的动力。他们希望成为游戏中的佼佼者——而要成为佼佼者，唯一的办法就是打败*所有其他人*，这应该并不奇怪。你可能认为*这种*性格类型很常见，但 Bartle 的研究表明，只有少数玩家是杀手型人格——准确地说，不到 1%。

有些人的游戏天性中以杀手型玩家为主，只有在自己赢而其他人都输的时候才会真正感到快乐。

## Don’t Stereotype

不要刻板印象

Given these four types, and especially the potentially dramatic appearance of the Killer, we might feel tempted to think of someone we know of and say, “Yes—he’s a Killer type. He’s only happy when he’s destroyed a city full of zombies on multi-player and knocks the other players out of the game.” Be that as it may in the case of that creepy lost-cause ex-friend who would barricade himself in his house on the weekend so he could ‘kill’ to his heart’s content, we have to look deeper. Also, there’s more to a Killer than a need to make others ‘bleed’, in the same way that Socializers don’t mindlessly flit about watering each other’s cyber-corn. Remember, more than one type may power the thought patterns of your players. Knowing them and understanding the context of their working environment is all-important.  
鉴于这四种类型，尤其是杀手可能具有的戏剧性外表，我们可能会忍不住想起我们认识的某个人，然后说：“是的，他是杀手类型。只有在多人游戏中摧毁一座充满僵尸的城市，并将其他玩家赶出游戏时，他才会感到高兴。”但对于那个周末把自己关在家里，随心所欲地“杀人”的令人毛骨悚然的失败前朋友，我们必须更深入地了解。此外，杀手不仅仅是需要让别人“流血”，就像社交者不会漫无目的地四处飞来飞去浇灌彼此的网络玉米一样。请记住，不止一种类型可以影响玩家的思维模式。了解他们并理解他们的工作环境背景至关重要。

It can be easy to assume that a competitive sales environment consists of Killers and Achievers, but it’s best to determine this through [survey](/literature/topics/surveys) and observation. What’s the exact nature of the working culture around your players? What would spur them on to achieve what goal in your design? In the references below, you’ll find a link to the Bartle Test. Why not try it for yourself—and then ask your players to try it?  
很容易假设竞争激烈的销售环境由杀手型和成就型组成，但最好通过[调查](/literature/topics/surveys)和观察来确定这一点。你的玩家周围的工作文化究竟是什么？什么会激励他们实现你设计中的什么目标？在下面的参考资料中，你会找到 Bartle 测试的链接。为什么不自己尝试一下——然后让你的玩家也尝试一下呢？

Killers and Achievers are most likely to appreciate features such as [leaderboards](/literature/topics/leaderboards); Socializers and Explorers, not so much. Developing the right mechanics for your players becomes much easier once you understand the way they like to approach a game.  
杀手型玩家和成就型玩家最有可能喜欢[排行榜](/literature/topics/leaderboards)等功能；社交型玩家和探索型玩家则不然。一旦您了解了玩家喜欢的游戏方式，为玩家开发合适的机制就会变得容易得多。

If you know the Bartle Player Types of your players, it will become much easier to meet their needs.  
如果您了解您的球员的 Bartle 球员类型，那么满足他们的需求就会变得容易得多。

## The Take Away

总结

There are four player types according to Bartle: Socializers, Explorers, Achievers and Killers. A gamification environment may consist of all or any combination of these types. Careful [player research](/literature/topics/gamification-user-research) will help you to understand which player types dominate the environment and thus help define how you will cater to their needs. It’s important to do the research and not just stereotype players. Understand what makes them tick and you’ll be able to incorporate features in your designs that will really latch with their inherent natures as players.  
根据 Bartle 的说法，玩家类型有四种：社交型、探索型、成就型和杀手型。游戏化环境可能由所有这些类型或任意组合组成。仔细的[玩家研究](/literature/topics/gamification-user-research)将帮助您了解哪些类型的玩家在环境中占主导地位，从而帮助您确定如何满足他们的需求。重要的是进行研究，而不仅仅是对玩家进行刻板印象。了解是什么让他们兴奋，您将能够在设计中加入真正符合他们作为玩家的固有性质的功能。
