Failure is essential to career success.  
失败对于事业的成功至关重要。

In a world obsessed with career success stories, we rarely hear about the stumbles, setbacks, and outright failures that precede them. From Thomas Edison's 10,000 unsuccessful attempts before inventing the light bulb to Steve Jobs being fired from Apple, history shows us that failure isn't the opposite of success. It's an essential part of the journey.  
在这个沉迷于事业成功故事的世界里，我们很少听说事业成功之前所遭遇的挫折、挫折和彻底的失败。从托马斯·爱迪生发明灯泡前的 10,000 次失败，到史蒂夫·乔布斯被苹果解雇，历史告诉我们，失败并不是成功的反面。它是人生旅程中必不可少的一部分。

 Failure, particularly early in your career, can foster greater long-term career success. Let's examine what research reveals about this relationship and how embracing setbacks can actually accelerate your professional development.  
失败，尤其是在职业生涯早期的失败，可以促进长期的职业成功。让我们来看看研究揭示了这种关系，以及如何接受挫折实际上可以加速你的职业发展。

 A [groundbreaking study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12189-3) from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management provides compelling evidence that early career setbacks can lead to more incredible long-term achievement. Researchers analyzed data from scientists who had applied for grants from the National Institutes of Health \(NIH\) early in their careers. They compared those who narrowly missed receiving funding with those who just managed to qualify. Over the next decade, scientists in the near-miss group were 6.1% more likely to publish studies in the top 5% of citations in their field than those who received the initial grants. Despite facing an early disappointment that could have derailed their careers, these scientists ultimately produced more influential work than those who experienced early career success.  
西北大学凯洛格管理学院的一项[开创性研究](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12189-3)提供了令人信服的证据，表明早期的职业挫折可以带来更令人难以置信的长期成就。研究人员分析了职业生涯早期向美国国立卫生研究院 \(NIH\) 申请资助的科学家的数据。他们将那些差点获得资助的人与那些勉强获得资助的人进行了比较。在接下来的十年里，与最初获得资助的科学家相比，差点获得资助的科学家发表研究成果进入其领域引用率前 5% 的可能性高出 6.1%。尽管早期的失望可能会毁掉他们的职业生涯，但这些科学家最终创作出了比早期事业成功的人更有影响力的作品。

 Failure isn’t just a setback—it can be a powerful force that propels your career forward. Here’s how.  
失败不仅仅是一种挫折——它还可以成为推动你事业前进的强大力量。原因如下。

 Professional success can sometimes lead to overconfidence and complacency, while failure serves as a powerful antidote to an inflated ego. When we experience [career setbacks](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2020/02/16/how-to-recover-from-a-career-setback/), we're reminded of our limitations and the continuous work required for improvement. This humility becomes an advantage in several ways:  
职业上的成功有时会导致过度自信和自满，而失败则是消除自我膨胀的良药。当我们遭遇[职业挫折](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2020/02/16/how-to-recover-from-a-career-setback/)时，我们会意识到自己的局限性，并意识到需要不断努力才能取得进步。这种谦逊在以下几个方面成为一种优势：

* You become more open to feedback and constructive criticism  
  你会更加乐于接受反馈和建设性的批评
* You're less likely to overestimate your abilities or take on projects beyond your capacity  
  你不太可能高估自己的能力或承担超出你能力的项目
* You develop greater empathy for others facing challenges  
  你会对面临挑战的其他人产生更大的同理心
* You maintain a learner's mindset rather than assuming you have all the answers  
  你保持学习者的心态，而不是假设自己知道所有答案
* You collaborate more effectively by recognizing and valuing others' strengths  
  通过认可和重视他人的优势，您可以更有效地进行合作

The most successful professionals often maintain this balance of confidence and humility by believing in their abilities while remaining acutely aware of their room for growth.  
最成功的专业人士往往通过相信自己的能力并敏锐地意识到自己的成长空间来保持自信与谦逊的平衡。

### 2.) Failure Inspires Positive Change

2.）失败激发积极的改变

Failure often serves as the catalyst for meaningful transformation. When our current approaches don't yield the career success we want, we're forced to innovate and evolve. These moments of disruption create hidden opportunities:  
失败往往是重大转变的催化剂。当我们目前的方法无法带来我们想要的职业成功时，我们就不得不创新和发展。这些颠覆时刻创造了隐藏的机会：

* Failure highlights ineffective strategies that need adjustment  
  失败凸显了需要调整的无效策略
* It pushes you to [develop new skills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/19/5-soft-skills-critical-in-the-age-of-ai/) that expand your professional toolkit  
  它促使你[发展新技能](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/19/5-soft-skills-critical-in-the-age-of-ai/)，扩展你的专业工具包
* Failed projects reveal valuable insights about process improvements  
  失败的项目揭示了有关流程改进的宝贵见解
* Setbacks often lead to unexpected pivots that open new career opportunities  
  挫折往往会导致意想不到的转变，从而带来新的职业机会
* The urgency created by failure can break through procrastination and resistance to change  
  失败产生的紧迫感可以突破拖延和对改变的抵制

Rather than viewing failure as a roadblock, [successful professionals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/28/success-myths-holding-you-back-from-achieving-your-career-goals/) recognize it as a signpost pointing toward necessary improvements and unexplored possibilities.  
[成功的专业人士](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinecastrillon/2025/01/28/success-myths-holding-you-back-from-achieving-your-career-goals/)不会将失败视为障碍，而是将其视为指向必要的改进和尚未探索的可能性的路标。

 When you embrace failure, you'll discover it offers unique insights that career success alone can’t provide. The perspective gained through failure creates several distinct advantages in your professional journey:  
当你接受失败时，你会发现它提供了职业成功本身无法提供的独特见解。通过失败获得的视角会为你的职业生涯带来几个明显的优势：

* Failure helps you distinguish between genuine obstacles and self-imposed limitations  
  失败可以帮助你区分真正的障碍和自我强加的限制
* It reveals blind spots in your thinking that career success might have concealed  
  它揭示了你的思维盲点，而这些盲点可能被职业成功所掩盖
* You gain clarity about which problems deserve your energy and which aren't worth the struggle  
  你会清楚哪些问题值得你付出精力，哪些问题不值得你努力
* Setbacks often illuminate alternative paths that may better align with your strengths  
  挫折往往会照亮可能更能发挥你优势的其他道路
* You develop the ability to see opportunities within challenges rather than just the challenges themselves  
  你将培养出在挑战中发现机遇的能力，而不仅仅是挑战本身

This perspective shift transforms how you approach your entire career, enabling you to navigate complexity with greater wisdom and foresight.  
这种视角的转变会彻底改变您对待整个职业生涯的方式，使您能够以更大的智慧和远见来应对复杂情况。

### 4.) Failure Strengthens Your Resilience Muscle

4.）失败会增强你的韧性

Resilience—the ability to bounce back from setbacks—is perhaps the most valuable career skill you can develop. You strengthen this mental muscle each time you face failure and continue forward. The resilience developed through failure manifests in several concrete ways that enhance your professional capabilities:  
韧性——从挫折中恢复的能力——可能是你能培养的最有价值的职业技能。每次面对失败并继续前进时，你都会增强这种心理力量。通过失败培养出来的韧性体现在几个具体方面，可以提高你的专业能力：

* Failure builds emotional stamina that helps you weather future professional storms  
  失败可以增强情感耐力，帮助你渡过未来的职业风暴
* You develop confidence in your ability to survive worst-case scenarios  
  你对自己在最坏情况下生存的能力有了信心
* The recovery process teaches practical coping strategies for managing stress  
  康复过程教会了人们应对压力的实用策略
* Overcoming setbacks proves your capability to persist when others might quit  
  克服挫折证明你有能力在别人可能放弃的时候坚持下去
* Each recovery reinforces that failure is an event, not an identity or final destination  
  每次恢复都进一步证明，失败只是一次事件，而不是一种身份或最终目的地

This resilience doesn't just help you survive professional challenges. It positions you to achieve long-term career success because you've developed the capacity to withstand pressures that derail others.  
这种韧性不仅能帮助你应对职业挑战，还能让你获得长期的职业成功，因为你已经培养了承受压力的能力，而这些压力会阻碍他人的进步。

### 5.) Failure Teaches You What You Want (and Don't Want)

5.）失败让你知道你想要什么（和不想要什么）

The process of recovering from failure naturally leads to important self-discoveries about your professional preferences and priorities. Consider how failure illuminates your career path in these specific ways:  
从失败中恢复的过程自然会让你对自己的职业偏好和优先事项有重要的自我发现。想想失败如何以这些具体的方式照亮你的职业道路：

* Failed experiences highlight which aspects of work drain your energy versus what energizes you  
  失败的经历凸显了工作中哪些方面会消耗你的精力，哪些方面会给你带来活力
* Setbacks create natural decision points that prompt reevaluation of your career direction  
  挫折会自然而然地让你做出决定，促使你重新评估自己的职业方向
* Disappointments often reveal misalignments between your values and your current path  
  失望往往表明你的价值观和你当前的道路不一致
* The emotional response to specific failures provides clear signals about what matters most to you  
  对特定失败的情绪反应提供了明确的信号，告诉你什么对你最重要
* Recovery periods offer rare space for contemplation about your authentic professional desires  
  恢复期为你提供了难得的时间来思考你真正的职业愿望

This clarity about your preferences becomes increasingly valuable as you progress, helping you make decisions that align with your genuine interests rather than simply following conventional paths to career success.  
随着你的进步，明确自己的偏好会变得越来越有价值，它可以帮助你做出符合你真正兴趣的决定，而不是简单地遵循传统的职业成功道路。

### 6.) Failure Enhances Your Problem-Solving Abilities

6.）失败增强了你解决问题的能力

When plans fall apart, you must analyze what went wrong, identify alternative approaches, and implement solutions under pressure. This challenging situation develops valuable capabilities that enhance your professional effectiveness:  
当计划失败时，你必须分析问题所在，找出替代方法，并在压力下实施解决方案。这种具有挑战性的情况可以培养出宝贵的能力，从而提高你的专业效率：

* You learn to dissect complex situations to identify root causes rather than just symptoms  
  你将学会剖析复杂情况，找出根本原因，而不仅仅是症状
* You become adept at generating multiple solutions rather than fixating on a single approach  
  您将能够善于提出多种解决方案，而不是只专注于单一方法
* You develop the ability to pivot quickly when initial efforts prove ineffective  
  当最初的努力被证明无效时，你会培养出快速转变的能力
* Your critical thinking improves as you distinguish between flawed execution and flawed strategy  
  当你区分有缺陷的执行和有缺陷的策略时，你的批判性思维就会提高
* You gain practical experience with systems thinking by understanding how variables interact  
  通过了解变量如何相互作用，您可以获得系统思维的实践经验

These advanced problem-solving skills become increasingly valuable as you advance in your career, particularly when facing unique situations requiring a fresh approach.  
这些高级的解决问题的技能会随着您职业生涯的进步而变得越来越有价值，特别是在面对需要新方法的独特情况时。

### 7.) Failure Builds Authentic Leadership Credibility

7.）失败可以建立真正的领导力信誉

Leaders who have experienced and overcome failures bring a depth of experience that resonates powerfully with others. This hard-won wisdom yields important leadership advantages leading to career success:  
经历过失败并克服失败的领导者拥有丰富的经验，能够与他人产生强烈共鸣。这种来之不易的智慧带来了重要的领导优势，从而带来职业成功：

* You can provide genuine guidance to team members facing similar challenges  
  您可以为面临类似挑战的团队成员提供真正的指导

  过去失败的脆弱性为创新和冒险创造了心理安全

  你会对哪些风险值得承担、哪些风险应该避免做出细致的判断
* Your personal resilience story inspires others facing professional adversity  
  你的个人坚韧故事激励了其他面临职业逆境的人

This credibility becomes a powerful professional asset, particularly in challenging environments where teams need leaders who understand struggle from firsthand experience.  
这种信誉成为了一种强大的专业资产，特别是在充满挑战的环境中，团队需要那些从第一手经验中了解困难的领导者。
