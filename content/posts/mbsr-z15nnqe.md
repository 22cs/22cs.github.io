# Getting Started in MBSR

This worksheet begins your MBSR journey. Actually writing your responses to these questions and those on the practice logs will help ground your practice and learnings in a way that would not be possible if you simply answered these questions in your head. In a way, this is the first mindfulness practice: being mindful of your intentions and commitment to the process you are about to begin. **NOTE**: As you go through the course, you may take longer than a week for any given “week”, and that’s fine. Knowing how much time you need is, in itself, mindfulness.

## Initial Reflection

So, first, there is probably something that drew you to this program that made it seem like a good idea. For example, you may wake up in the middle of the night with worries and concerns that keep you from getting a good night’s sleep, or you may be dealing with difficult health issues, or you may have trouble concentrating, or you may simply want to increase your ability to be present and fully engaged in life, to accept more fully yourself/others, just as you/they are.

**By the end of the course, I am hoping that:**

1. 更加集中，更加专注
2. 内心更加平静

## Recognizing Strengths

While there are things you hope that will get better, it is important to recognize positive aspects of yourself, because it is these things that form the base for any self-improvement. We tend to take for granted our own core strengths, so give yourself a few minutes to reflect on this. For instance, what would a good friend or close family member say that they appreciate about you?

**Some of my strengths are:**

1. 年轻

## Planning Your Practice

Finding a specific time and place for your half-hour of daily practice is likely to be one of the most difficult hurdles, and writing down now when and where you’ll be doing your daily practice will help you to keep your promise to yourself to practice each day. People often choose to practice first thing in the morning, before roommates or family members are up and about, and others like the evening shortly before bedtime, or just after arriving home from work. Precisely when you practice is less important than having a set time and place, a time that you know you can practice without having to attend to the telephone or be responsive to others, and a place that is quiet and separate from others.

**When will I practice?**  (Try to be concrete, e.g., 6:30am M-F, 7:30am Sat/Sun): Morning and Evening
**Where I am planning to practice** (e.g., corner of the bedroom, basement, etc.): my bedroom

## Scheduling Readings and Videos

The readings and videos for each “week” take about 2 hours. You are more likely to do the assigned readings and videos if you choose a particular day of the week and time to do this. If you don’t do these all at once, it’s fine to spread the videos and reading out over a period of several days.

**The times and day(s) of the week I will do the videos and readings: Wednesday**
