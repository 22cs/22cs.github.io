肩膀疼

昨天的正念练习也没做

今天要做了

> ### Formal Practice
>
> Read *The Body Scan Meditation*. On the first day, do the *Raisin Meditation* (have two raisins and a glass of water handy). For the next five days, do the *Body Scan*. Don’t expect to feel anything in particular from these practices. In fact, give up all expectations about it. Just let your experience be your experience.
>
> Audio guidance for the practices can be found through the top menu on any of the Palouse pages. **NOTE:**  One of your six formal practices can be one of the live meditations from a meeting listed on the *Zoom Meeting* page.
>
> Record on this form each time you do a practice. In the comment field, put just a few words to remind you of your impressions of that particular practice: what came up, how it felt, what you noticed in terms of physical sensations, emotions, thoughts, etc. It’s important to write the comments immediately after the practice because it will be hard to reconstruct later.
>
> Once you have done at least six days of practice and feel that you've gotten the essence of this "Week", you may go to the next week, although you can stay here longer if that feels right.
>
> ### Informal Practice
>
> Each day this week, see if you can bring mindful awareness to some otherwise routine activity and record it on the *Informal Practice Log (Simple Awareness)* .
