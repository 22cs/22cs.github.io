I’m Amy Bernstein.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：您正在收听的是《哈佛商业评论》的《职场女性》节目。我是艾米·伯恩斯坦。</p><p>AMY GALLO: And I’m Amy Gallo. This is our <em>Essentials</em> series, where we explore key career skills and make management advice practical and relatable.<br>艾米·加洛：我是艾米·加洛。这是我们的“Essentials”系列，我们将在其中探讨关键的职业技能，并提供实用且易于理解的管理建议。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: We do that by bringing together experts on those skills and audience members who want to get better at them.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：我们这样做的目的是召集这些技能方面的专家和想要提高这些技能的观众。</p><p>AMY GALLO: OK, Amy B, I have been in many meetings with you over the years, and you are particularly good at asking purposeful questions.<br>艾米·加洛：好的，艾米·B，这些年来我与您开过很多次会议，您特别擅长提出有目的的问题。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: What do you mean by that, Amy?<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：艾米，你这话是什么意思？</p><p>AMY GALLO: [Laughter]<br>艾米·加洛：[笑声]</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Purposeful questions have a clear purpose. They’re intentional.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：有目的的问题有明确的目的。它们是有意图的。</p><p>AMY GALLO: And they also are clear in that we know exactly what you’re getting at.<br>艾米·加洛：他们也清楚，我们完全知道你的意思。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: They have impact. They should elucidate a point, or they should move the conversation forward in some way.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：它们有影响力。它们应该阐明一个观点，或者应该以某种方式推动对话向前发展。</p><p>AMY GALLO: And they invite openness rather than defensiveness.<br>艾米·加洛：他们提倡开放态度，而不是防御态度。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: I just want to note here that these are the same traits that you see in executive presence. They come from confidence and draw on your emotional intelligence, your ability to read the room.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：我只想指出，这些特质与高管气质相同。它们源自自信，并依赖于你的情商和你洞察现场的能力。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Yeah. That actually ties really well into why our audience-member-slash-guest volunteered for this episode. Her name is Meagan. I’ll let her introduce herself.<br>AMY GALLO：是的。这实际上与我们的观众/嘉宾自愿参加本期节目的原因非常吻合。她的名字是 Meagan。我让她自我介绍一下。</p><p>MEAGAN: I am a program manager in a biotech company, and I’ve been in a staff level role for, oh gosh, it’s probably been, like, four years. I ask questions that I’m super comfortable asking, and those can be questions that focus on the execution of a particular task or deliverable.<br>MEAGAN：我是一家生物科技公司的项目经理，我担任员工级别的职位已经有四年了。我会问一些我非常乐意问的问题，这些问题可能侧重于某项特定任务或可交付成果的执行。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Meagan’s looking to advance, maybe through a promotion, maybe by working in a different part of the business. But the clear feedback she’s gotten is that she needs to develop executive presence. And then a colleague recently pushed their team to think more strategically.<br>AMY GALLO：Meagan 希望获得晋升，也许是通过升职，也许是通过在公司的其他部门工作。但她得到的明确反馈是，她需要培养高管风范。最近，一位同事敦促他们的团队更具战略性地思考。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Aha.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：啊哈。</p><p>MEAGAN: And that’s got me thinking, <em>Oh, well, how do I ask questions in a strategic way; as well as, how do I ask questions in a way that helps me move forward in my career?</em><br>梅根：这让我开始思考，好吧，我该如何以一种策略性的方式提出问题呢？还有，我该如何以一种有助于我职业发展的方式提出问题呢？</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Excellent questions.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：问题问得非常好。</p><p>AMY GALLO: With no easy answers. Because her first concern—how do I ask questions in a strategic way—isn’t only about taking the entire business into account, it’s also about tone and delivery.<br>AMY GALLO：没有简单的答案。因为她首先关心的——我该如何以战略性的方式提问——不仅仅是要考虑整个业务，还与语气和表达方式有关。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: And that means negotiating tensions. You want to ask for the information you need without undermining your credibility. You want to get to the point but not leave out important context. You want to push for clarity without coming across as hostile. And in the moment, it’s not always clear how to frame a question so that it lands the way you want it to.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：这意味着要协商解决紧张局势。你要询问所需的信息，但又不能损害你的信誉。你要直奔主题，但不能遗漏重要的背景。你要努力澄清事实，但不能表现出敌意。而在当下，如何提出问题，才能让问题以你想要的方式得到解决并不总是很清楚。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Right.<br>艾米·加洛：对。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: And because of these stakes and tensions, our guest expert, Alison Wood Brooks, describes conversation as “one of the most complex and uncertain of all human tasks.”<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：由于这些利害关系和紧张局势，我们的客座专家艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯将对话描述为“所有人类任务中最复杂和最不确定的任务之一”。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: We’re all just sort of all the time trying to read ourselves, trying to read the person across from us and read the room, the context all around us. And those are really high-level skills that we all need to continue to work on sort of forever.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：我们总是试图了解自己，了解对面的人，了解房间，了解我们周围的环境。这些都是非常高级的技能，我们所有人都需要永远努力掌握。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Alison’s literally a scholar on the subject.<br>艾米·加洛：艾莉森确实是该领域的学者。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: At Harvard Business School.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：在哈佛商学院。</p><p>AMY GALLO: And she’s published a book called <em>Talk: The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves</em>.<br>艾米·加洛：她出版了一本书，名为《谈话：对话的科学和做自己的艺术》。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: More from me after Amy G’s interview with Alison and Meagan.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：艾米·G 采访艾莉森和梅根后，我将发表更多消息。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Meagan, Alison, thank you both for joining me. And I have to note how meta this all feels because as I was prepping, I was thinking about the questions I wanted to ask the professor who studies questions and the person who wants to get better at questions and knowing you’re both going to ask me questions. So, this is going to be really fun.<br>AMY GALLO：Meagan、Alison，感谢你们两位的参与。我必须指出，这一切感觉非常复杂，因为在准备时，我一直在思考我想问研究问题的教授和想要提高问题解决能力的人的问题，并且知道你们俩都会问我问题。所以，这会非常有趣。</p><p>MEAGAN: Very excited for the conversation today.<br>梅根：非常期待今天的谈话。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Thank you so much for having us. I’m so excited to connect. And I’m with you, it’s very meta to talk about talking.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：非常感谢您的邀请。我很高兴能和您联系。我和您一样，谈论谈话是一件非常重要的事情。</p><p>MEAGAN: Yes.<br>梅根：是的。</p><p>AMY GALLO: So, Meagan, let’s get a little more context of where you are skill-wise in this and what your experience is like. Tell us about a time you asked a question where you know you landed it, you got exactly the information or response or connection that you were looking for.<br>AMY GALLO：那么，Meagan，让我们进一步了解一下你在这方面的技能水平以及你的经验。请告诉我们你问过一个问题，你知道自己回答正确，你得到了你想要的信息、回应或联系。</p><p>MEAGAN: Yes, there was actually… I was attending one of our department summit meetings we had a couple of years back, and I had the opportunity to ask our GM of our region as well as, at the time, our chief commercial officer some questions that I was very passionate about on a topic. And I had about 10 seconds to jot down what am I going to ask and be handed a microphone and be able to just ask it in a way that I really wanted to elicit a response. I felt really confident when I asked the question though. I will say I did blackout after I asked it because it was a little nerve wracking. But I got really clear and detailed on the point. And the response I got was actually people in the room applauded because the leaders, it took them a while to respond.<br>MEAGAN：是的，实际上……几年前我参加了我们部门峰会，有机会就某个话题向我们的地区总经理以及当时的首席商务官提出了一些我非常感兴趣的问题。我大约有 10 秒钟的时间记下要问的问题，然后递上麦克风，以一种我真正想要得到答复的方式提出问题。不过，当我问出这个问题时，我感到非常自信。我会说，问完之后我确实昏了过去，因为有点紧张。但我对这个问题的回答非常清楚和详细。我得到的回应是，房间里的人们鼓掌，因为领导们花了一段时间才做出回应。</p><p>They were like, <em>Do you want to take this one?</em> And actually it was such a good question that I got a lot of feedback after I asked. I had actually my boss’s boss come up to me and say, “Thank you for asking that question. It shows that our team is thinking critically about this problem.” But that was a time where I was very passionate about the topic. I was able to get the question down, nervous though, of asking it to these senior leaders, but I was able to get a good response afterwards.<br>他们问，你想回答这个问题吗？事实上，这个问题非常好，我问完之后得到了很多反馈。我老板的老板甚至来找我说：“谢谢你问这个问题。这表明我们的团队正在认真思考这个问题。”但那时我对这个话题非常热衷。我把问题写下来了，虽然我很紧张，因为我要问这些高层领导，但之后我得到了很好的回应。</p><p>AMY GALLO: All right, so tell us about an opposite experience sometime where you either regretted not asking a question or you asked in a way that just sort of flopped.<br>艾米·加洛：好的，请告诉我们一个相反的经历，有时候你会后悔没有提出问题，或者你提问的方式有点失败。</p><p>MEAGAN: So, a recent scenario where chief of staff of our R&amp;D came and gave a presentation, and I asked the question, it was a little open-ended. And I realized that after the fact because I could tell from her facial expression and her tone that she’s like, *Why are you asking me this? It is pretty obvious of what this is. *And I realized that I wasn’t being as specific as I could have been.<br>MEAGAN：最近有一次，我们研发部门的参谋长来做报告，我问了一个问题，这个问题有点开放。事后我才意识到这一点，因为我从她的面部表情和语气中可以看出，她想问，你为什么问我这个问题？这个问题很明显。我意识到我没有尽可能具体地说明。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Right. I’m curious, Alison, what you’re hearing in those two contrasting examples. I’m sure you’re hearing lots of things that are reflected in your research.<br>AMY GALLO：是的。Alison，我很好奇你从这两个对比鲜明的例子中听到了什么。我相信你听到了很多反映在你的研究中的东西。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: So many things, you guys. First, both of the examples you gave were in groups, it was in front of a lot of people. Group conversation is remarkably different, categorically different than one-on-one private conversation. We tend to think of conversation as the same task everywhere, no matter how many people are there. But as soon as a third person pulls up a chair, even this conversation with the three of us is remarkably different than if it were just Meagan and Amy, or just Alison and Amy, or just Alison and Meagan. It means that one person there can sit and not say anything and still be part of the conversation. When you’re one-on-one, that’s not the case. You have to keep the, sort of, tennis ball alive going back and forth across the net.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：你们说的太多了。首先，你们举的两个例子都是在群体中进行的，有很多人。群体对话与一对一的私人对话截然不同。我们倾向于认为对话在任何地方都是一样的，无论有多少人。但是一旦第三个人拉过一把椅子过来，即使是我们三个人的对话也与只有梅根和艾米，或者只有艾莉森和艾米，或者只有艾莉森和梅根时的对话截然不同。这意味着一个人可以坐在那里不说话，仍然可以参与对话。当你一对一时，情况就不一样了。你必须让网球在网前来回移动。</p><p>And as group size grows, the coordination challenges of keeping a conversation alive and smooth grow exponentially. The risks of shame and judgment also grow exponentially. A lot of people who are not high status in their organizations feel a lot more comfortable and more power when they are in smaller one-on-one interactions. And so the more you can leverage that, the better things are going to go. If you can pull that boss aside after the big group meeting and say, “Oh, actually I meant to ask that question this way, would you mind chatting about that a little bit?” That feels so much more approachable, and that conversation might be a lot more productive than trying to ask even the same question in front of the group.<br>随着团体规模的扩大，保持对话活跃和顺畅的协调挑战也成倍增加。羞辱和评判的风险也成倍增加。许多在组织中地位不高的人在小规模的一对一互动中会感到更自在，更有权力。因此，你越能利用这一点，事情就会越好。如果你能在大型会议结束后把老板拉到一边说：“哦，其实我本来想这样问这个问题，你介意聊一聊吗？”这让人感觉更容易接近，而且这种谈话可能比在小组面前问同样的问题更有成效。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Is that true for you, Meagan? Do you feel more comfortable asking the questions one on one?<br>艾米·加洛：梅根，你也是这样吗？一对一提问你会觉得更自在吗？</p><p>MEAGAN: Definitely. In those higher stakes situations where it’s a larger group, I have to either prepare or if it’s off the cuff, shame is definitely something that comes up.<br>MEAGAN：当然。在那些风险较高、人数较多的场合，我必须做好准备，否则如果是即兴发挥，肯定会感到羞耻。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: It’s waiting right there like a specter on the doorstep. You’re not alone. So, this is a feeling that most people feel, introverts for sure. And even in some of our research we have found that women have a very strong preference for smaller intimate conversation compared to large groups, likely because women tend to occupy positions of lower status a lot of the time. So, it’s sort of all tied together. But-<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：它就像门口的幽灵一样在那里等待着。你并不孤单。所以，这是大多数人都会有的感觉，内向的人肯定是这样。甚至在我们的一些研究中，我们发现女性更喜欢小规模的亲密谈话，而不是大群体的谈话，这可能是因为女性往往占据着地位较低的位置。所以，这一切都是联系在一起的。但是-</p><p>AMY GALLO: I would posit too, Alison, that’s also because our failures tend to be judged more harshly.<br>艾米·加洛：艾莉森，我也这么认为，这是因为我们的失败往往会受到更严厉的评判。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: For sure, yes, it’s not wrong. These preferences have evolved from a place of reality—actually you are judged more harshly sometimes if you say something, and then we put pressure on ourselves if we’re not saying anything. So anyway, it just gets really complicated. So that’s the first thing when I was hearing about these stories, Meagan, is the distinction between intimate and groups. What can be very empowering is to think, <em>Well, how can I leverage the comfort I feel in one-on-one conversation?</em> Often you do have power over structuring the size of your conversations. Who can you talk to before a big group meeting? Who can you talk to after and how can you leverage that a little bit more?<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：当然，没错。这些偏好是从现实中发展而来的——实际上，如果你说了什么，你有时会受到更严厉的评判，如果我们什么都不说，我们就会给自己施加压力。所以无论如何，这真的很复杂。梅根，当我听到这些故事时，我首先想到的是亲密关系和群体之间的区别。最能让人振奋的是思考，好吧，我如何利用一对一谈话中感受到的舒适感？通常，你可以控制谈话的规模。在大型团体会议之前，你可以和谁交谈？在会议结束后，你可以和谁交谈？你如何才能更好地利用这种感觉？</p><p>And then one other thing that I heard in the way you describe these stories is you tend to ask questions that feel comfortable. And then when you described your success question asking, you described it as passionate. It was a question I was passionate about. And in that moment I was like, <em>Oh, I love it so much</em>. Not only do you sound like you are dying to ask that question, but it took some courage to do it. And whether it’s in a group in a high-stakes situation or one on one, every little micro decision we make when we shift to a new topic or ask a new question, it really is like a risk. It takes courage to say, <em>Am I going to go here?</em><br>然后，我从你描述这些故事的方式中听到的另一件事是，你倾向于问一些让人感到舒服的问题。然后，当你描述你问成功问题时，你把它描述为充满激情。这是一个我充满激情的问题。在那一刻，我想，哦，我太喜欢它了。你不仅听起来很想问这个问题，而且问这个问题需要一些勇气。无论是在高风险情况下的群体中，还是一对一，当我们转向新话题或提出新问题时，我们所做的每一个微小决定，都真的像是一种风险。需要勇气才能说，我要去这里吗？</p><p>And it sounds like sometimes when you feel like you’re not finding that courage and not able to take those risks, that’s when your questions are coming out as a little bit mundane or less articulate or you’re not really asking the question that you are actually dying to ask.<br>听起来，有时候，当你感觉自己找不到那种勇气，无法承担那些风险时，你的问题就会变得有点平淡无奇或不太清晰，或者你并没有真正问出你真正想问的问题。</p><p>AMY GALLO: I got to follow up on that, Alison, because if the research says we tend to be more fearful or hesitate to ask questions when we’re lower status, obviously we don’t want to wait. Meagan doesn’t want to wait until she gets the promotion to start asking the questions. So how do we psych ourselves into the courage we need regardless of our status?<br>AMY GALLO：Alison，我得继续问这个问题，因为如果研究表明，当我们的地位较低时，我们往往更害怕或犹豫不决，显然我们不想等待。Meagan 不想等到升职后才开始问问题。那么，无论我们的地位如何，我们如何才能鼓起勇气呢？</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Already we’ve talked about one thing, which is leverage intimate one-on-one conversation where you’re going to feel more brave anyway and where it feels safer for the other person to answer, that you’re not putting them on the spot and giving them the risk of shame. The other thing I think that can feel really empowering is good conversationalists align their choices with the goals of the conversation. And so a little bit of reflection ahead of time of, <em>what are my goals in this interaction, and what do I think other people’s goals are?</em><br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：我们已经讨论过一件事，那就是利用亲密的一对一对话，在这种对话中，无论如何你都会感到更勇敢，对方回答问题也会感到更安全，你不会让他们当场出丑，也不会让他们有蒙羞的风险。我认为另一件能让人感到真正有力量的事情是，好的谈话者会将他们的选择与谈话的目标结合起来。所以，提前思考一下，我在这次互动中的目标是什么，我认为其他人的目标是什么？</p><p>Particularly at work, if you even think for 30 seconds, <em>Oh, the goal of this meeting is we need to choose someone to hire. So, my questions should be helping guide the group towards making a decision to hire someone</em>. Or, <em>our goal here is to generate as many ideas about this new product as possible</em>. So just keeping in mind what are we doing here, what are our needs and goals, will help you make better choices about the types of questions that you should be asking.<br>尤其是在工作中，如果你花 30 秒思考一下，哦，这次会议的目标是我们需要选择一个人来雇用。所以，我的问题应该有助于引导团队做出雇用某人的决定。或者，我们的目标是尽可能多地提出有关这个新产品的想法。所以只要记住我们在这里做什么，我们的需求和目标是什么，就能帮助你更好地选择应该问的问题类型。</p><p>AMY GALLO: So, Meagan, one of the things that was on your mind you told us was asking questions that for lack of a more nuanced way to say this that didn’t make you look stupid. And so I’m curious if you have any questions for Alison about how to do that.<br>AMY GALLO：所以，Meagan，你告诉我们，你考虑的事情之一是问一些问题，因为缺乏更细致入微的方式来表达，这样你才不会显得愚蠢。所以我想知道你是否对 Alison 有什么问题，如何做到这一点。</p><p>MEAGAN: Yeah. How do you keep credibility asking questions knowing that you’re not gonna come across as knowledgeable about a particular subject but showing that you are curious and want to learn more and not necessarily distracting from the conversation?<br>MEAGAN：是的。你如何保持可信度，在提问时，你明知自己不会对某个主题知识渊博，但又表现出你很好奇，想要了解更多，而且不一定会分散谈话的注意力？</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: You can literally just say, “Can you say more?” “Can you keep going?” “Can we hear more about this?” And I think often we put pressure on ourselves to come up with this well-phrased question when in fact what you need from another person is for them to just say a little bit more because you’re not actually understanding what they’re saying. And “Can you say more?” is a wonderful question. That’s enough. That is a show of your competence that you see that there’s value in what they’re saying.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：你可以直接说，“你能再说点吗？”“你能继续说下去吗？”“我们可以听听更多吗？”我认为我们经常给自己施加压力，想出这个措辞恰当的问题，而实际上你需要别人再说一点，因为你实际上并没有理解他们在说什么。“你能再说点吗？”是个很好的问题。这就足够了。这表明你有能力，你看到他们说的话很有价值。</p><p>In a way, it’s the ultimate open-ended question. So, when we studied open-ended questions, there are lots of ways to phrase open-ended questions. One is by starting it with a <em>what</em>, like, “Tell me what else is on your mind” or “What did you do this morning?” “What were you thinking about when you prepared for this meeting?” That’s a beautiful open-ended question. And you could frame all of those same questions by starting with <em>why</em>. Why questions are still technically open-ended, but they’re more accusatory. It sort of pulls back on the lovely relational motives and things that we need in conversation to have it feel safe and productive.<br>从某种程度上来说，这是终极的开放式问题。因此，当我们研究开放式问题时，有很多种表达开放式问题的方法。一种是以“什么”开头，例如“告诉我您还有什么想法”或“您今天早上做了什么？”“您在准备这次会议时想到了什么？”这是一个很棒的开放式问题。您也可以以“为什么”开头来组织所有这些问题。“为什么”问题在技术上仍然是开放式的，但它们更具指责性。它有点撤回了我们在对话中需要的可爱关系动机和事物，以使对话感觉安全和富有成效。</p><p>So, leaning more towards the, “What is on your mind?” “Can you tell me more?” “Tell me your perspective,” those questions are really productive, and it doesn’t take much from you to formulate them. You just need to say, “What did you mean?” “What were you thinking about?” “What are you feeling right now?” and sort of put the ball back in their court.<br>因此，更倾向于问“你在想什么？”“你能告诉我更多吗？”“告诉我你的观点”，这些问题确实很有成效，而且你不需要花太多精力去构思。你只需要说“你的意思是什么？”“你在想什么？”“你现在感觉如何？”然后把球重新交给他们。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Would that work for the scenarios you’re thinking of, Meagan?<br>艾米·加洛：梅根，这对于您所想象的场景有用吗？</p><p>MEAGAN: It would, but how do I also though not trail off in those questions?<br>梅根：确实如此，但是我怎样才能在这些问题上不落窠臼呢？</p><p>AMY GALLO: Yeah, and Alison, before you answer that question, can you, Meagan, give us a sense of, like, where are you asking these sorts of questions? Is this on one-on-ones, in meetings?<br>艾米·加洛：是的，艾莉森，在你回答这个问题之前，梅根，你能告诉我们，你在哪里问这些问题吗？是在一对一的谈话中，还是在会议上？</p><p>MEAGAN: I would say either in one-on-ones or in smaller groups. And actually, I lead an employee resource group, I’m leading the meetings, and I am discovering as I’m asking questions to the group, for example, “Are there any other points of feedback that we want to capture before we make a decision about X, Y and Z?” I’ll trail off at the end. And so it’ll be like, “What do you think about this…?” And then it’s like, I know they know what I’m talking about, but it’s like I get stuck. It’s like, how do I really complete this sentence or ask this question in a way that’s going to sound intelligent, but then halfway through it’s like, <em>Oh, this is just tapering off</em>?<br>MEAGAN：我会说，要么是一对一，要么是小组讨论。实际上，我领导一个员工资源小组，主持会议，我在向小组提问时发现，例如，“在就 X、Y 和 Z 做出决定之前，我们是否还有其他反馈意见需要收集？”最后我会停顿下来。然后我会问，“你觉得这个怎么样……？”然后，我知道他们知道我在说什么，但我好像卡住了。我该如何完成这句话或以一种听起来很聪明的方式提出这个问题，但到了一半，我又想，哦，这只是逐渐停止？</p><p>And a lot of the times they ask me to repeat it. They ask, “Is this what you’re asking?” And I think where it’s coming from is the fact that I don’t feel confident when I’m asking the question, but I know I need to keep the conversation going.<br>很多时候他们都会让我重复一遍。他们会问，“这就是你要问的吗？”我想这是因为我在问这个问题时缺乏自信，但我知道我需要继续谈话。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Alison. Help us fix this.<br>艾米·加洛：艾莉森。帮我们解决这个问题。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Meagan, are you in this scenario… are you in a Zoom meeting or are you face to face?<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：梅根，你是这种情况吗&mldr;&mldr;你是在参加 Zoom 会议，还是面对面会议？</p><p>MEAGAN: It’s always a virtual meeting.<br>梅根：这始终是一次虚拟会议。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Always virtual. So, I was going to say any group conversation can be very demoralizing, but especially virtual meetings where people are muted and you’re not even getting the sort of back-channel feedback, which is people going, “Yeah. Mm-hm. Uh-huh.” In natural conversation face to face, that’s like a version of cheerleading where your partners and the people in the group are cheering you on as you’re formulating this question to say, <em>Yes, keep going. We also want to ask this question</em>. In virtual meetings you can’t get that. It’s not surprising to me that you’re sort of trailing off midway because you need that cheerleading, you need that sort of co-narration in order to just get the sense of, am I heading in a good direction or not?<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：总是虚拟的。所以，我想说，任何群体对话都可能令人沮丧，尤其是虚拟会议，人们被禁言，你甚至得不到那种后台反馈，也就是人们说，“是的。嗯。嗯。”在面对面的自然对话中，这就像啦啦队的一种形式，你的搭档和小组成员在你提出这个问题说“是的，继续前进”时为你加油。我们也想问这个问题。在虚拟会议中你得不到这一点。我并不惊讶你会在中途停顿下来，因为你需要那种啦啦队，你需要那种共同叙述，才能知道我是否在朝着好的方向前进？</p><p>And the silent void that you get in a virtual meeting is sort of soul-crushing in that way. And so by the time you get to the end of your question, you have no idea whether you’re asking it clearly or asking the right question. So, I think just knowing that and getting to a place of acceptance of, <em>I’m not going to get that verbal back-channel feedback that’s going to help me keep going</em>. Just get to a place where you’re more comfortable with that, and it is actually soul-crushing, and it’s not you. It’s the modality of that you’re communicating on.<br>虚拟会议中的沉默空虚在某种程度上令人心碎。所以当你问完问题时，你不知道自己问得清楚还是问对了问题。所以，我认为，仅仅知道这一点并接受这一点，我不会得到那些可以帮助我继续下去的口头反馈。只要你找到一个更舒服的地方，这实际上是令人心碎的，这不是你的问题。这是你交流的方式。</p><p>In my course when I teach students about conversation, I have them record themselves and listen back. And without fail, one of the first things everyone notices is how inarticulate they are and how many filler words they have, and they’re totally mortified. And so they’ll say, Oh, I’m going to work so hard this semester to stop saying um an uh and trailing off. And then we talk about like, No, don’t do that. That is how natural dialogue works. You cannot plan out whole sentences before you say them. So, you are coming up with what you’re saying as you’re saying it. Trailing off is a sign of uncertainty. It gives a signal to the people around you that you are formulating a bigger, more articulate idea.<br>在我的课程中，当我教学生如何对话时，我会让他们录下自己的对话，然后听回放。毫无例外，每个人首先注意到的事情之一就是他们说话时有多么不清晰，有多少填充词，他们完全被吓到了。所以他们会说，哦，这个学期我会非常努力地停止说“嗯，呃”和“拖沓”的句子。然后我们会说，不，不要这样做。这就是自然对话的运作方式。你无法在说话前计划好整个句子。所以，你是在说话的同时想出你要说的话。拖沓是不确定的表现。它向你周围的人发出一个信号，表明你正在构思一个更大、更清晰的想法。</p><p>And so I am not sure that the problem here is with you trailing off. I think what you’re hungry for is you want fully formed thoughts that are really incisive. And so it’s not about the ums and uhs and the trailing off. It’s sort of like, how can I frame my question in a way that really gets to the heart of what we’re trying to do here? And for that there are different ways that you can think about framing your question. You can ask people thinking questions versus feeling questions: “What are you thinking about this?” “How are you feeling about it?” You can ask people positive versus negative: “What would be the positive outcome of us doing this?” “What would be the negative outcome of us doing this?”<br>所以我不确定你是不是在拖延。我认为你真正想要的是完整而深刻的想法。所以问题不在于“嗯”、“啊”和“拖延”。这有点像，我该如何提出问题，才能真正触及我们在这里试图做的事情的核心？为此，你可以用不同的方式来构思你的问题。你可以问人们思考问题而不是感受问题：“你对此有何看法？”“你对此有何感受？”你可以问人们积极问题而不是消极问题：“我们这样做会有什么积极结果？”“我们这样做会有什么消极结果？”</p><p>You can ask, “Let’s consider this from a different perspective.” So, “For whom would this decision be good? Which stakeholder in this situation?” You can ask <em>when</em> questions: “When was this a good thing? I know this was a good thing in the past and we’re feeling a little uncertain about it now, what’s going to happen with us in the future?” So past, present, future questions can be really incisive. And so for that you could sort of practice getting good at it on the fly, or you can think about brainstorming those types of questions before a meeting begins: <em>What do we need to talk about? Do we need to talk about the past, the present, the future?</em> <em>Which stakeholders do we care about? Do we need to talk about what we’re thinking or what we’re feeling? Or both?</em> A little bit of brainstorming ahead of time can be quite helpful.<br>您可以问：“让我们从不同的角度考虑这个问题。”因此，“这个决定对谁来说是好的？在这种情况下，哪个利益相关者？”您可以问“什么时候”的问题：“这是一件好事？我知道这在过去是一件好事，但现在我们对此感到有点不确定，未来会发生什么？”所以过去、现在、未来的问题可能非常尖锐。因此，您可以练习在工作中熟练掌握它，或者您可以在会议开始前考虑集思广益这些类型的问题：我们需要讨论什么？我们需要谈论过去、现在还是未来？我们关心哪些利益相关者？我们需要谈论我们正在想什么还是我们的感受？还是两者兼而有之？提前进行一点头脑风暴可能会非常有帮助。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Are those helpful Meagan?<br>艾米·加洛：梅根，这些对我们有帮助吗？</p><p>MEAGAN: It actually is. And I think one thing that you mentioned, Alison, that’s really resonating with me is the human element of asking a question. It’s okay to say the ums and to trail off, and I think that’s kind of where I’ve been a little self-conscious is how to sound as crisp as say another coworker I have that I look up to. She’s really good at asking questions and also just on the fly of being very articulate when the conversation is dynamic.<br>MEAGAN：确实如此。Alison，我认为你提到的一件事让我深有感触，那就是提问的人性因素。说“嗯”和停顿是可以的，我认为这就是我有点不自在的地方，就是如何让自己听起来像我尊敬的另一位同事一样清晰。她非常擅长提问，而且在对话充满活力时，她总是能即兴地表达自己的想法。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: And every conversation is a combination of forethought and flexibility in the moment. We as humans have a tendency to see amazing talkers and feel like there’s a sort of myth of naturalness, like, Oh, they’re so amazing, this is so easy for them. You have no idea how much work that person did before the meeting, how hard they are trying in the meeting, how much follow-up they’re doing afterwards. So when things look easy and skilled for other people, you just never know. I’m sure that it’s not just coming to her spontaneously in the moment and she’s probably spent her whole lifetime practicing that skill too.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：每一次谈话都是深思熟虑和灵活应对的结合。我们人类倾向于看到那些说话很棒的人，并觉得他们有一种自然的神话，比如，哦，他们太棒了，这对他们来说太容易了。你不知道他们在会议前做了多少工作，他们在会议中有多努力，他们在会后做了多少后续工作。所以当别人觉得事情很容易、很熟练时，你永远不知道。我敢肯定，她不是一时之间自发地想到这一点的，她可能也花了一生的时间练习这种技能。</p><p>And then the final thing that I will say is when you start to look at hundreds of thousands of transcripts of real conversations, you realize conversations are a train wreck. And so we interrupt each other constantly. We fade away in the middle. We have half-finished ideas, we get excited about this and then we move on to something else and we forget to talk about the thing we needed to talk about. We all put so much pressure on ourselves for it to feel perfect and polished and productive, but the bottom line is that it’s a very complicated coordination game that is never going to be perfect. So, finding a bit of grace for yourself and for other people is a really great place to start.<br>最后我想说的是，当你开始查看数十万份真实对话记录时，你会发现对话就像一场灾难。所以我们经常打断对方。我们在中途就断了。我们有一些未完成的想法，我们对此感到兴奋，然后我们转向其他事情，我们忘记谈论我们需要谈论的事情。我们都给自己施加了很大的压力，希望它感觉完美、精致和富有成效，但归根结底，这是一场非常复杂的协调游戏，永远不会完美。所以，为自己和他人找到一点优雅是一个很好的开始。</p><p>AMY GALLO: When you said you have a colleague who you admire in terms of how crisp she is in asking questions, I want to reach out and hug you because try being Amy B’s co-host on this podcast, she can ask… I will ask the question in four messy sentences that, trust me, gets the point across and then she’ll just ask it in four words with some beautiful vocab word I hadn’t heard in five years. But yet I will tell you I could allow it to hurt my confidence, but I really see it as a style thing. It’s just a different style. I’m sure editing me is really hard for our producer because I do ask those questions that go on and on sometimes, but I think I also bring some richness to it or some emotion or some connection with the guest.<br>AMY GALLO：当你说你有一位同事，你很钦佩她提问时的干脆利落时，我想伸手拥抱你，因为试试做 Amy B 在这个播客上的联合主持人，她可以问……我会用四个凌乱的句子问问题，相信我，这些问题能把要点表达清楚，然后她会用四个词来问，而且会用到一些我五年没听过的漂亮词汇。但我还是要告诉你，我可能会因此打击我的自信心，但我真的认为这是一种风格问题。只是风格不同而已。我相信对我们的制片人来说，编辑我的内容真的很难，因为有时我确实会问那些没完没了的问题，但我认为我也为它带来了一些丰富的内容、一些情感或与嘉宾的联系。</p><p>So yes, you want to… Amanda’s telling me in the chat that I do. Thank you. Yes, maybe emulating and even watching that colleague and studying what they do, and yet I also don’t want you to try to do something that’s not you because part of what it sounds like is that the anxiety in that moment when you start trailing off is the problem, not the trailing off necessarily, right? You’re like, <em>Oh, did I sound like I didn’t know what I was doing? Am I not being leaderly enough? Am I leaving everyone confused?</em> But maybe you just let it trail off and see what responses come back and if people need clarity, then you can give clarity.<br>所以是的，你想……Amanda 在聊天中告诉我我想这么做。谢谢。是的，也许可以模仿甚至观察那位同事并研究他们的做法，但我也不希望你尝试做一些不适合你的事情，因为听起来，当你开始拖延时，那一刻的焦虑才是问题所在，而不一定是拖延本身，对吧？你会想，哦，我听起来是不是像不知道自己在做什么？我是否没有足够的领导力？我是否让每个人都感到困惑？但也许你只是让它拖延，看看会有什么反应，如果人们需要澄清，那么你可以给出澄清。</p><p>MEAGAN: I really like that. I think it’s so helpful to hear that’s a different style. And I definitely have a trailing wandering style.<br>梅根：我真的很喜欢。我认为听到这种不同的风格很有帮助。而且我确实有一种随性游走的风格。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: It’s very warm, actually. You really pull people in. You can tell you’re very thoughtful and that you really care, so you might be the perfect person to be on a team where everybody’s moving too fast and not listening well and their questions are too quick and clipped. They need someone like you to sort of break the pace and slow it down and say, “Well let’s think about this in another way.” Thinking about group composition in that way could be really empowering, I hope.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：实际上，这非常温暖。你真的能吸引人们。你可以看出你非常体贴，你真的很关心，所以你可能是团队中的完美人选，在这个团队中，每个人都行动太快，不善于倾听，他们的问题太快太简短。他们需要像你这样的人来打破节奏，放慢速度，说：“好吧，让我们换个角度思考这个问题。”我希望以这种方式思考团队组成可能会真正赋予人们力量。</p><p>MEAGAN: I feel really good about the feedback around that because I don’t think I hear it enough of, “Your style of communicating works well within this group dynamic,” or at least appreciating where I’m coming from. And sometimes when I’ve asked for feedback and said, “Please give me feedback on this particular thing,” sometimes the feedback is just, “Oh, you did great.” And I really want to improve or find specific examples of, “You did great here, and this is why.”<br>MEAGAN：我对这方面的反馈感到非常满意，因为我觉得我听到的反馈还不够多，比如“你的沟通方式在这个团队中很有效”，或者至少对我的出发点表示赞赏。有时当我征求反馈并说“请就这件事给我反馈”时，有时反馈只是“哦，你做得很好。”我真的想改进或找到具体的例子，“你在这里做得很好，这就是原因。”</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Recent research suggests that it’s easier for people to give more constructive ideas to you if you ask for their advice rather than feedback. So backward looking feedback feels harsh because it’s already happened and it’s sort of like saying you did a bad job. But if you say, “if we’re going to do that meeting again, what advice would you give to me about how to do this differently?” then it feels like you’re brainstorming together and preparing for something that has yet to come, and so it feels less harsh to say, “Oh yeah, I love how you put together. Your slide design is gorgeous. I love how you explain this idea. Next time I wonder if you could be a little more pithy when you’re explaining X, Y, and Z.”<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：最近的研究表明，如果你征求别人的建议而不是反馈，他们更容易给你提供更具建设性的想法。因此，回顾性反馈会让人感觉很刺耳，因为它已经发生了，有点像在说你做得不好。但是如果你说，“如果我们要再次开会，你会给我什么建议，让我做点不同的事情？”那么感觉就像你们在集思广益，为尚未发生的事情做准备，所以说“哦，是的，我喜欢你的组合方式。你的幻灯片设计很漂亮。我喜欢你解释这个想法的方式。下次你在解释 X、Y 和 Z 时，能不能更简洁一点？”这样感觉就没那么刺耳了。</p><p>That’s also going to be easier to hear than them saying, “Hey, you were super long-winded when you talked about this in your presentation.” So just a slight reframe of forward-looking advice seeking that rather than backward-looking feedback.<br>这也比他们说“嘿，你在演讲中谈论这个问题时太啰嗦了”更容易被接受。因此，只需稍微重新构建前瞻性的建议，而不是回顾性反馈。</p><p>AMY GALLO: We do have an Essentials episode similar to this one called <a href=https://hbr.org/podcast/2023/01/the-essentials-getting-the-feedback-you-need>Getting the Feedback You Need</a>, which we cover some of that thinking about getting feedback about the questions might be helpful to give another listen to that one.<br>艾米·加洛：我们确实有一集与这一集类似的“Essentials”节目，名为“获取您需要的反馈”，我们在其中介绍了一些关于如何获取问题反馈的想法，再听一听这一集可能会有所帮助。</p><p>MEAGAN: Definitely. I love the reframing.<br>梅根：当然。我喜欢这种重新构图。</p><p>AMY GALLO: So, let’s talk about the questions where you need to dig into what’s really going on in this situation. Because I know this was another area, Meagan, that you were trying to work on asking questions when the situation isn’t clear or something’s held up. Is there a scenario you’re thinking of specifically, Meagan, for this kind of question?<br>AMY GALLO：那么，让我们来谈谈您需要深入了解这种情况下真正发生了什么的问题。因为我知道这是另一个领域，梅根，当情况不明朗或某些事情被搁置时，您试图提出问题。梅根，您是否专门考虑过这种问题的场景？</p><p>MEAGAN: It’s going back to maybe a one-on-one conversation that I have with a senior leader. And I know that they’re a couple steps above and I’m really trying to ask them the strategy questions and trying to uncover why we are making particular decisions and understanding how the strategy is developed. And I want to be able to ask it in a way that also allows them to provide the reasons why things are happening and not come across as confrontational.<br>MEAGAN：这可以追溯到我与高层领导的一对一谈话。我知道他们比我高出几步，我真的想问他们战略问题，试图发现我们为什么做出特定的决定，并了解战略是如何制定的。我希望能够以一种让他们能够提供事情发生原因的方式提出问题，而不是让他们觉得有对抗性。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: It sounds like you’re hungry for more information exchange. I think often we have an instinct to say, <em>Well, what’s the right question to ask?</em> And as a scholar of conversation, I feel like putting too much pressure on yourself to ask the right question might not be the right way to think about it. Instead, what we see when we study transcripts is that it’s more like the pattern of questioning that’s good as the conversation unfolds that is good at diving deeper and deeper and getting more information exchange rolling in the conversation. So instead of focusing on that first question or what’s the right way to formulate this question., imagine if you just pushed yourself to ask more follow-up questions.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：听起来你很渴望进行更多的信息交换。我认为我们经常会本能地问，那么，什么问题才是正确的？作为一名研究对话的学者，我觉得给自己施加太大的压力来问出正确的问题可能不是正确的思考方式。相反，我们在研究记录时发现，随着对话的展开，提问的模式会越来越深入，从而让对话中的信息交换更加顺畅。因此，想象一下，如果你不是专注于第一个问题，也不是专注于提出这个问题的正确方式，而是强迫自己问出更多的后续问题。</p><p>So, no matter what information they start with, you just keep pushing and saying, “Well, what were you thinking about when you made that decision?” Or, “If you went to 30,000 feet, what conceptually are you thinking about here?” And sort of don’t stop asking until you get to a place where you feel like they’re giving you that sort of valuable treasure that you’re looking for. It almost has nothing to do with the initial question and more to do with, <em>I’m going to listen as this unfolds and I’m going to keep asking until we get to a place where I feel like I’m getting the information that I need</em>. And what’s so funny, that sounds so simple, but most people forget to keep asking follow-up questions.<br>所以，无论他们一开始提供什么信息，你都要继续问：“那么，你在做这个决定时考虑的是什么？”或者，“如果你去了 30,000 英尺的高空，你在这里考虑的概念是什么？”不要停止询问，直到你觉得他们给了你正在寻找的那种宝贵的宝藏。这与最初的问题几乎毫无关系，更多的是，我会倾听事情的进展，我会继续询问，直到我们觉得我得到了我需要的信息。有趣的是，这听起来很简单，但大多数人都忘了继续问后续问题。</p><p>As soon as somebody you ask one question, they give an answer and then you’re like, <em>Oh, I guess we got to move on</em>. No, you should keep going. In my class we do an exercise called never-ending follow-ups, where you’re required to ask a follow-up question every time you speak, which sounds very extreme in theory, but in practice it’s super fun. You’ll very quickly get past small talk. You’ll get very deep on a topic. Good conversationalists are good at changing topics frequently, but also getting really deep on them quickly, often through asking lots of follow-up questions.<br>只要有人问你一个问题，他们就会回答，然后你就会想，哦，我想我们得继续了。不，你应该继续。在我的课上，我们做一项名为“永无止境的后续问题”的练习，要求你每次说话时都问一个后续问题，这在理论上听起来很极端，但在实践中却非常有趣。你很快就会结束闲聊。你会对一个话题进行深入讨论。好的谈话者擅长频繁改变话题，但也能很快深入讨论，通常是通过问很多后续问题。</p><p>AMY GALLO: I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been like, <em>I did not like that person because they asked difficult questions</em>. But dozens and dozens of times I’ve said, <em>That person didn’t ask me a single question</em>.<br>艾米·加洛：我可以用一只手数出我说过“我不喜欢那个人，因为他们问了难题”的次数。但我说过“那个人没有问我任何问题”的次数有几十次了。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: This is so important, Amy, that a very important point that I hope will be helpful to you, Meagan: there really is no such thing as a sensitive question, but there is very much sensitive contexts. A lot of people have fears that by asking something too intrusive or too sensitive that people are going to get mad or hurt or sort of these high arousal negative emotions. But it’s actually a lot less common than the quieter killer of conversation, which is boredom and disinterest.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：艾米，这一点非常重要，我希望这一点对你有所帮助，梅根：实际上并不存在所谓的敏感问题，但存在非常多的敏感背景。很多人担心，如果问一些过于侵犯隐私或过于敏感的问题，人们会生气或受伤，或者产生高度唤起的负面情绪。但实际上，这种情况比更安静的谈话杀手——无聊和不感兴趣——要少见得多。</p><p>If we’re too scared to ask interesting, pointed, sensitive things, then the risk is that the whole conversation is completely forgettable and mundane and feels meaningless, and that’s actually a more common occurrence in conversation than the anger, hostile feelings.<br>如果我们不敢问一些有趣、尖锐、敏感的问题，那么整个谈话就有可能变得完全不值得谈论、变得平淡无奇、毫无意义，而这在谈话中实际上比愤怒和敌意更为常见。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Meagan, you had a question about asking questions that demonstrate your leadership qualities that you’re ready to take on more responsibility. Do you want to ask Alison about that?<br>艾米·加洛：梅根，你问了一个问题，问这些问题可以表明你的领导才能，表明你已经准备好承担更多责任。你想问艾莉森这个问题吗？</p><p>MEAGAN: Yes. I really have been thinking about, how do I move away from always the comfortable questions. Or even it’s like, how do I ask this to show that I’m thinking strategically or thinking I want to move up or make a big career leap, and I want it to be known to other people when I’m having these conversations, I’m interested in this. And so, I guess, how to move away from just the execution type questions and moving into a more leadership focused mindset when asking questions.<br>MEAGAN：是的。我一直在思考，我该如何摆脱那些让人感到舒服的问题。或者，我该如何提出这个问题，才能表明我在进行战略思考，或者我想升职或实现职业飞跃，并且我希望在进行这些对话时让其他人知道，我对此很感兴趣。所以，我想，在提问时，如何摆脱仅仅关注执行力的问题，转而采用更注重领导力的思维方式。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Wow, I love this. I love hearing you sort of step into your power even saying this question out loud. It’s really wonderful. A very simple idea is trying to say your goals out loud. And that’s probably not necessarily about you, but maybe about the needs of everyone who’s involved in the conversation: “It seems to me like you need this” or “I’m going to say something because I care so much about you succeeding,” or “I think everybody’s feeling a little anxious about this, so I’m going to say this.”<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：哇，我喜欢这个。我喜欢听到你发挥自己的力量，甚至大声说出这个问题。这真的很棒。一个非常简单的想法就是试着大声说出你的目标。这可能不一定是关于你自己的，但可能是关于参与对话的每个人的需求：“我觉得你需要这个”或“我要说点什么，因为我非常关心你的成功”，或者“我想每个人都对此感到有点焦虑，所以我要说这个。”</p><p>Literally saying, like, what is your strategic thinking, what is your perception of people’s goals, what are we aiming for as a group, literally saying that out loud more explicitly can be quite helpful because it allows people then to agree, “Yes, that is our goal.” “Yes, that is how we’re feeling.” Or to say, “Oh, actually no, I’m not feeling anxious about that, but I am feeling scared about this other thing,” or “I am excited about this other thing.” So, linguists call this grounding. It’s sort of always revising and weeding your shared reality, your shared understanding of what’s going on. Good strategic thinkers are good at providing a very clear platform of what are our goals and what are we doing here that allows other people to pile on and say yes or to disagree with it and sort of repair that understanding.<br>从字面上说，比如，你的战略思维是什么，你对人们的目标有什么看法，我们作为一个群体的目标是什么，更明确地大声说出来会很有帮助，因为它可以让人们同意，“是的，这是我们的目标。”“是的，这就是我们的感受。”或者说，“哦，其实不，我对此并不感到焦虑，但我对另一件事感到害怕，”或“我对另一件事感到兴奋。”所以，语言学家称之为基础。它总是在修改和剔除你们共同的现实，你们对正在发生的事情的共同理解。优秀的战略思想家善于提供一个非常清晰的平台，说明我们的目标是什么，我们在这里做什么，让其他人加入进来，说是或不同意，并修复这种理解。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Well, and I have a slightly different take on the sort of how I prove my capability of moving forward, which is to really ask an analytical question, something along the lines of, “I understand we’re not going to move this initiative forward. What would have to be true in the future for us to do that?” And shows that I’m invested in the future of this team or this initiative or this organization. That doesn’t conflict with what you are saying, Alison, but I think it’s another tactic that I’d have found works for me.<br>AMY GALLO：好吧，对于如何证明我有能力继续前进，我的看法略有不同，那就是真正提出一个分析性问题，类似于“我知道我们不会继续推进这项计划。未来我们需要什么条件才能做到这一点？”并表明我对这个团队、这项计划或这个组织的未来投入了精力。这与你所说的并不矛盾，艾莉森，但我认为这是另一种对我有用的策略。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: The more you can figure out what your colleagues want and need and what the organization wants and needs, and you show effort in pursuing those things, it just signals indirectly like, <em>I’m part of this, and I’m aligned with the mission, and I want to be helpful at it because I see a future here, because I want to succeed in this place</em>.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：你越能弄清楚你的同事想要什么、需要什么，组织想要什么、需要什么，并且你为追求这些事情而付出努力，这就间接地表明，我是这个组织的一部分，我与这个组织的使命保持一致，我想为这个组织提供帮助，因为我在这里看到了未来，因为我想在这个地方取得成功。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Thank you both. I really enjoyed this, and I’m taking away so much.<br>艾米·加洛：谢谢你们两位。我非常喜欢这个节目，收获颇多。</p><p>ALISON WOOD BROOKS: Amy, you’re such a fabulous facilitator of a three-person group. And Meagan, I just wanna gobble you up, you’re so wonderful.<br>艾莉森·伍德·布鲁克斯：艾米，你真是一个出色的三人小组主持人。梅根，我只想把你吞掉，你太棒了。</p><p>MEAGAN: I really appreciate this opportunity and being able to speak with both of you. It’s been really rewarding, and I feel more confident in my style now that I’ve had this conversation, so thank you. I really appreciate the confidence boost.<br>梅根：我真的很感激这次机会，能够和你们两位交谈。这真的很有意义，而且经过这次谈话，我对自己的风格更加自信了，所以谢谢你们。我真的很感激你们增强了我的信心。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Amy B, you’re back.<br>艾米·加洛：艾米·B，你回来了。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: I am back and I’m here with someone who helps us ask purposeful questions every episode of this show.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：我回来了，和我一起的人会在每一集节目中帮助我们提出有目的的问题。</p><p>AMY GALLO: That’s right. Our producer, Amanda Kersey.<br>艾米·加洛：没错。我们的制片人是阿曼达·克西。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Hello. Yes, I decided to come out from behind the scenes and insert myself here.<br>阿曼达·克西：你好。是的，我决定走出幕后，加入到我们的行列。</p><p>AMY GALLO: We’re glad you did.<br>艾米·加洛：我们很高兴您这么做。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: You’re always here with us.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：您一直和我们在一起。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: I am usually just four feet back at that computer, but I have lots of thoughts about asking purposeful questions. But I wanted to pick up on something that Amy G mentioned to Meagan and Alison about you two having different styles and how she doesn’t want to be self-conscious about that. It’s just a style thing. That’s all okay. But as you know… because I think I shared it with you a few months ago when I was getting really into my ChatGPT assistant, the <em>Women at Work</em> AI—that I asked it to describe your interviewing styles, just so I could save that as a knowledge file.<br>AMANDA KERSEY：我通常离电脑只有四英尺远，但我对提出有目的的问题有很多想法。但我想谈谈 Amy G 向 Meagan 和 Alison 提到的一件事，关于你们两人的风格不同，以及她不想对此感到不自在。这只是一个风格问题。没关系。但正如你所知……因为我记得几个月前我在真正使用我的 ChatGPT 助手 Women at Work AI 时与你分享过——我要求它描述你的面试风格，这样我就可以将其保存为知识文件。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Right, based on our transcripts.<br>艾米·加洛：是的，根据我们的记录。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Based on… I uploaded all the transcripts from the show, every single one of them, and what came out was unbelievable and very kind. So, the AI assistant said, “Amy Gallo frequently seeks out advice that listeners can apply to their own lives. Her questions often dig into the how and why of specific behaviors or strategies aiming to extract clear actionable insights. She’s particularly skilled at asking follow-up questions to get more detailed, tangible answers from experts.”<br>AMANDA KERSEY：根据……我上传了节目的所有文字记录，每一条记录，结果令人难以置信，非常友善。因此，AI 助手说：“Amy Gallo 经常寻求听众可以应用于自己生活的建议。她的问题经常深入探讨特定行为或策略的来龙去脉，旨在提取清晰的可操作见解。她特别擅长提出后续问题，以便从专家那里获得更详细、更切实的答案。”</p><p>AMY GALLO: I hear it—<br>艾米·加洛：我听说——</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: It’s so kind.<br>阿曼达·克西：你真是太好了。</p><p>AMY GALLO: It is kind, but it’s so funny.<br>艾米·加洛：这很友善，但也很有趣。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: It’s accurate.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：这是准确的。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: And accurate. Well, and I have to say, I feel a little like Meagan right now where I’m like, OK, it’s just my style. Because I hear that and I’m like, I ramble. I get it. I ramble.<br>阿曼达·克西：而且很准确。好吧，我不得不说，我现在感觉有点像梅根，我觉得，好吧，这就是我的风格。因为我听到这些，我就会觉得，我在胡言乱语。我明白了。我在胡言乱语。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Has anyone ever said you ramble or is that just your self-assessment?<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：有人说过您说话喋喋不休吗？或者这只是您的自我评价？</p><p>AMY GALLO: It’s just my self-assessment. Sometimes I feel a little like Meagan sometimes where I’m halfway through the question. I’m like, <em>Where am I going with this? What am I saying?</em> And I think in contrast to you, Amy B—and I can’t wait for you to read what Amy B’s style is—but in contrast to you, sometimes it’s like these five words that just get to the point so quickly. And I understand that you’ve been an editor for many, many years. You’ve been trained to do that, but it’s just such a skill. And if I were more insecure, I think I would really shrivel in comparison to you. But I loved Alison’s take on this and reassurance to Meagan of there’s just a different style and it doesn’t make the question less purposeful.<br>AMY GALLO：这只是我的自我评估。有时我觉得自己有点像梅根，有时我问了一半问题。我想，我要说什么？我要说什么？我认为与你不同，Amy B——我迫不及待地想让你看看 Amy B 的风格——但与你不同，有时就像这五个字就能很快切中要点。我知道你当编辑已经很多年了。你受过这方面的训练，但这只是一项技能。如果我更不自信，我想我真的会比你逊色。但我喜欢艾莉森对此的看法，她向梅根保证，这只是一种不同的风格，这并不会降低这个问题的目的性。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: And even if your questions are a little windy, our AI is still saying you extract clear actionable insights. So even if you’re windy, you’re getting the goods.<br>AMANDA KERSEY：即使你的问题有点儿离题，我们的人工智能仍然会告诉你，你已经获得了清晰可行的见解。所以即使你问的问题有点儿离题，你也能得到有用的信息。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Ultimately.<br>艾米·加洛：最终是这样。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: And they’re always entertaining and engaging.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：它们总是充满乐趣和吸引力。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Thank you.<br>艾米·加洛：谢谢。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: We’re on the journey with you, Amy.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：艾米，我们和你一起踏上旅程。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: We are.<br>阿曼达·克西：是的。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Thank you.<br>艾米·加洛：谢谢。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Let me flip this page and Amy Bernstein’s style. “Amy Bernstein is not afraid to challenge ideas or ask harder thought-provoking questions. Her questions often encourage guests to think more critically or consider alternate perspectives. This can result in a deeper, more nuanced exploration of the topic.”<br>AMANDA KERSEY：让我来谈谈 Amy Bernstein 的风格。“Amy Bernstein 不怕挑战想法或提出更难的发人深省的问题。她的问题经常鼓励嘉宾进行更批判性的思考或考虑不同的观点。这可以导致对主题进行更深入、更细致的探索。”</p><p>AMY GALLO: That resonates so much for me.<br>艾米·加洛：这引起了我很大的共鸣。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: I’ve noticed no mention of warmth.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：我没有注意到有人提到温暖。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Well, below is, “professional, yet personal.”<br>阿曼达·克西：好吧，下面是“专业而又个性化”的。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Your warmth comes through in your curiosity.<br>艾米·加洛：你的热情体现在你的好奇心之中。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: So Amy B, we haven’t talked on the show yet. Y’all haven’t talked about the fact that you got a promotion recently. You are now HBR’s editor in chief. Thinking about how Meagan wants to impress executives, the senior leader—she wants to get up there in her own industry one day. What are the types of questions that you’re listening for as an executive when you’re in the room with people who are more junior, maybe you pick up on the fact that they’re trying to impress you or they just happen to impress you? What are you listening for?<br>阿曼达·克西：艾米·B，我们节目上还没聊过。你们还没有谈及你最近升职的事。你现在是《哈佛商业评论》的主编。想想梅根想给高管、高级领导留下深刻印象——她想有一天在自己的行业中出人头地。作为一名高管，当你和资历较浅的人共处一室时，你会听到什么样的问题？也许你会注意到他们试图给你留下深刻印象，或者他们恰好给你留下了深刻印象？你在听什么？</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Well, let me tell you what I pick up on. I pick up on genuine curiosity questions that bespeak a person’s understanding of the idea and commitment to embracing it by understanding it better. I really do appreciate questions that smoke test an idea, unless they’re smarty-pants questions. The questions I like are the ones that open my mind to new thinking, make me consider things I ought to have considered, but may have missed.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：好吧，让我告诉你我注意到了什么。我注意到那些真正好奇的问题，这些问题表明一个人理解了这个想法，并决心通过更好地理解它来接受它。我真的很欣赏那些对想法进行烟雾测试的问题，除非它们是自作聪明的问题。我喜欢的问题是那些能打开我的思路，让我思考那些我应该考虑但可能错过的事情的问题。</p><p>AMY GALLO: And what you’re saying that you look for is not someone who just pokes holes, but someone who in the interest of the larger pursuit, the goal we’re trying to—may poke holes or may ask hard questions. One of the questions I like to ask when I’m trying to understand a decision someone in a senior leadership position has made more clearly is, “what other options did you consider and why did we go with this one?”<br>AMY GALLO：你说你要找的不是只会挑毛病的人，而是一个为了更大的追求、为了我们试图实现的目标而挑毛病或提出尖锐问题的人。当我试图更清楚地理解高层领导做出的决定时，我喜欢问的一个问题是：“你考虑过其他什么选择，为什么我们选择了这个？”</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: That is such a great, great question. And when you have asked me that you make me stop and think.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：这个问题问得太棒了。你问这个问题的时候，让我停下来思考。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: When you ask a question like that, Amy, asking someone to explain their reasoning behind the decision, like what alternatives they consider… that can be a sensitive question, that could put somebody on the defense. So do you work up to that kind of question? What are you doing before you ask that.<br>阿曼达·克西：艾米，当你问这样的问题时，要求某人解释他们做出决定的理由，比如他们考虑过哪些替代方案……这可能是一个敏感的问题，可能会让某人产生防御心理。那么你会准备回答这样的问题吗？在问这个问题之前你会做什么？</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: No, she doesn’t.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：不，她不知道。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: You don’t go right into that.<br>阿曼达·克西：你别直接谈论这个。</p><p>AMY GALLO: I mean, I think that’s where tone comes in. I might say, “Help me understand this further.” Or I might even set it up with, “I’m thinking about how I’m going to explain this to a stakeholder or customer or client, whatever. Help me understand what other options did we…” I mean, because the tone of that question could be very challenging. You mentioned sensitive questions, Amanda, and we didn’t talk too much in the conversation with Alison and Meagan, but Alison, in her book, she is pretty bold about saying there are no sensitive questions.<br>AMY GALLO：我的意思是，我认为语气很重要。我可能会说，“帮我进一步理解这一点。”或者我甚至可以这样说，“我正在考虑如何向利益相关者或客户或客户等解释这一点。帮我理解我们还有什么其他选择……”我的意思是，因为这个问题的语气可能非常具有挑战性。你提到了敏感问题，阿曼达，我们在与艾莉森和梅根的谈话中没有谈太多，但艾莉森在她的书中大胆地说没有敏感问题。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: There’s only sensitive context.<br>阿曼达·克西：只有敏感内容。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Exactly. I do have one thing to say about that. When people are asking the really sort of sensitive questions, I think that is the moment to be really straightforward.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：没错。我确实有话要说。当人们问一些非常敏感的问题时，我认为那是直截了当的时候。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Yes.<br>阿曼达·克西：是的。</p><p>AMY GALLO: In the response or in the question?<br>艾米·加洛：是在回答中还是在问题中？</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Well, always in the response, but in the question as well. Because I’ve been on the receiving end of the sensitive question, and sometimes I struggle to understand the question itself. What are you really asking me? And I’ll ask them.<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：嗯，总是在回答中，但也在提问中。因为我曾经被问过敏感问题，有时我很难理解问题本身。你到底在问我什么？我会问他们。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: “Say more.”<br>阿曼达·克西：“多说点。”</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Or I’ll say, “I don’t quite understand what you’re trying to find out,” which isn’t pushing back. It’s a request for clarification.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：或者我会说，“我不太明白你想知道什么”，这并不是在反驳。而是在请求澄清。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: I have found that leading with the reason you’re asking will make clear your motive and also offer clarity. Because when you’re nervous, maybe your question is coming out not so clear. So, if you start by saying, “I’m really trying to understand this,” or, “Our teammates and I, we’ve had this concern, and we’re trying to understand that,” can show the benevolence with which you’re coming to the conversation.<br>AMANDA KERSEY：我发现，以提问的原因作为开场白，可以明确你的动机，并提供清晰的答案。因为当你紧张时，你的问题可能说得不太清楚。所以，如果你一开始就说“我真的想了解这一点”，或者“我们的队友和我，我们一直有这个顾虑，我们正在努力了解这一点”，这可以显示出你参与对话时的善意。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Stating the intention of, “I need this clarity. I need the answer to this question in order to do my job or to help guide my team,” or whatever it is, gives them the context in which you’re going to use the answer, too. So, I think it takes down the heat. I think one of the preambles to a question also could be—this is something I take from difficult conversations research—is stating a shared goal. “I know we’re both trying to do X, we’re trying work through this incredibly uncertain time for our organization…” So, you’re putting you and the other person in a collaborative mindset as opposed to a combative mindset.<br>AMY GALLO：说出“我需要这个清晰的答案。我需要这个问题的答案才能完成我的工作或帮助指导我的团队”之类的意图，也可以让他们知道你将在什么情况下使用这个答案。所以，我认为这可以缓解紧张情绪。我认为问题的开场白之一也可以是——这是我从困难对话研究中得出的结论——陈述一个共同的目标。“我知道我们都在努力做 X，我们正在努力度过这个对我们组织来说非常不确定的时期……”所以，你和对方处于一种合作的心态，而不是一种对抗的心态。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: I think that’s right. And when you’re talking about strategy, a new product, something like that, chances are, as the asker of the question, you want to be able to sell this idea further out and you can say that: “I want to make sure I understand this so I can do a better job persuading others about it.” Who wouldn’t want to help, right?<br>AMY BERNSTEIN：我认为是这样。当你谈论战略、新产品或诸如此类的事情时，作为提问者，你很可能希望能够进一步推销这个想法，你可以说：“我想确保我理解这一点，这样我才能更好地说服别人。”谁不想帮忙呢，对吧？</p><p>AMY GALLO: Yes.<br>艾米·加洛：是的。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: Okay. No further questions. Thanks for having me.<br>阿曼达·克西：好的。没有其他问题了。感谢你们的邀请。</p><p>AMY GALLO: Thank you, Amanda. Can you come over to the table more times?<br>艾米·加洛：谢谢你，阿曼达。你能再来我们这边几次吗？</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: I might just roll on over here and there.<br>阿曼达·克西：我可能会到处乱逛。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: Roll the three feet over.<br>艾米·伯恩斯坦：把三英尺翻过来。</p><p>AMANDA KERSEY: I’ll roll the three feet over.<br>阿曼达·克西：我会把三英尺滚过去。</p><p>AMY BERNSTEIN: That’s our show.
